   abstract = {New calibration tools in the {\it pyFAI} suite for processing scattering experiments acquired with area detectors are presented. These include a new graphical user interface for calibrating the detector position in a scattering experiment performed with a fixed large area detector, as well as a library to be used in {\it Jupyter notebooks} for calibrating the motion of a detector on a goniometer arm (or any other moving table) to perform diffraction experiments.},
